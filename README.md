# 3d engine
Engine of 3d graphics that uses canvas 2d context in order to draw visuals. Allow spectator movement (left, right, forward, backward, down, up), as well as looking around (mouse) and changing movement speed (scroll). Doesn't work on mobiles, because mouse is needed. For now can render points and lines which can form bigger structures. Uses Fullscreen API and point locker API (mouse locker API). Recommended browser: google chrome.
